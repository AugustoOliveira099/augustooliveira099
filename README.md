## 🧠 About Me

I am a **Computer Engineer** and **M.Sc. student** at the **Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte (UFRN)**, with research interests in **Artificial Intelligence**, **Natural Language Processing**, and **intelligent agents** applied to **large-scale geophysical and seismic data**.

I am currently a **scholarship research fellow** in the project **Cognitive Assistant for Geophysical Data**, a **research collaboration between UFRN and Petrobras**, where I develop a **multi-agent system in Python** that enables **interactive seismic data analysis through natural language**. My work involves combining **machine learning**, **NLP**, **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)**, and **big data technologies** to support decision-making in seismic data processing. I also work extensively with **database systems** to persist, query, and version information throughout the analytical workflow.

Previously, I worked as a **Front-End Developer** at UFRN’s IT Superintendence, focusing on **interactive, intuitive, and accessible web interfaces**.
